# Epirank üèÜ

Epirank is a program that retrieves all students and their GPAs from EPITECH
and makes them available by web & JSON.

The first time you will start the server, it will update the datase and then will update it every day around 3am.

## Project

The webservice runs using :
- [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) framework and listen on the port `8080`.
- [Go-sqlite3](https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3) as a SQLite driver.
- [Logrus](https://github.com/Sirupsen/logrus) for logging.

## Endpoint

There is only one route :

- `GET /` : It can take some parameters in the query.

|Parameter|Description|Optional|
|---|---|---|
|city|The city we want (STG, ...). If parameter is not present we ask for every city.|‚úÖ|
|promotion|The promotion we want (tek1, tek2, ...)|‚úÖ|
|format|We can ask JSON. If not present, returns the HTML ranking page|‚úÖ|

## Authentication file

	"login": "email",
	"password": "password"
}
```
